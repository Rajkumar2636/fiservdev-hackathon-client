# Fiserv Hackathon Demo Project

This is the Fiserv EMEA Hackathon Demo Project Template, designed for use in the 'code-a-long' session we are running.

Details on run and build the project are below, otherwise make sure you have the following pre-requisits:

* git client installed, e.g.
  * Standard git command line - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line
  * Github Desktop Client - https://desktop.github.com/
* npm installed
  * https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

## How to build / run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Gets set up with all required dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
